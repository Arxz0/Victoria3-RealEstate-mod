# Victoria 3 - Real Estate Mod (Configuration Logic)

This repository contains the source files (mostly YAML/TXT config files) for a custom mod developed for the strategy game Victoria 3.

## 🛠 Technical Focus

* **Configuration Syntax:** Experience editing complex nested YAML and TXT files, ensuring strict syntax compliance to prevent game crashes (log analysis).
* **Software Logic:** Understanding how changes in configuration variables (e.g., resource prices, construction costs) impact the execution of the game's economic engine.
* **Version Control:** Using Git to manage different iterations and test versions of the mod.
